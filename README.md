# JS-Particles
Fun interactive particle effect

Vanilla javascript/html/css files run in your browser. Built on chrome.

Generates 1000 particles of varying size, weight, and colour that will rotate around the mouse position. Can be used as a base for a lot of different effects. 

You can change the effect radius, number of particles generated, and speed of rotation with the interaction_radius, num_particles, and norm variables respectively although I found that anything much more than 1000 particles and lag becomes a bit of an issue.
